## Install
Requires [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)

```
pip install jaws-libp
```

**Note**: Using newer versions of Python may be problematic because the dependency `confluent-kafka` uses librdkafka, which often does not have a wheel file prepared for later versions of Python, meaning setuptools will attempt to compile it for you, and that often doesn't work (especially on Windows).   Python 3.9 does have a wheel file for confluent-kafka so that's your safest bet.  Wheel files also generally only are prepared for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.  Plus only for architectures x86_64 and arm64, also only for glibc.  If you use with musl libc or linux-aarch64 then you'll likely have to compile librdkafka yourself from source.

## API
[Sphinx Docs](https://jeffersonlab.github.io/jaws-libp/)

## Build
This [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/) project is built with [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/setuptools.html) and may be run using the Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) feature to isolate dependencies.   The [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) tool can be used to download dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp
cd jaws-libp
python -m build
```

## Release
1. Bump the version number in pyproject.toml and commit and push to GitHub (using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)).   
1. Create a new release on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/releases) page corresponding to same version in pyproject.toml (Enumerate changes and link issues)
1. [Publish to PyPi](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/actions/workflows/pypi-publish.yml) GitHub Action should run automatically.  Else:
    1. Clean build by removing `build`, `dist`, and `docsrc/source/_autosummary` directories
    1. Activate [virtual env](https://gist.github.com/slominskir/e7ed71317ea24fc19b97a0ec006ff4f1#activate-dev-virtual-environment)
    1. From venv build package, build docs, lint, test, and publish new artifact to PyPi with:
```
python -m build
sphinx-build -b html docsrc/source build/docs
pylint src/jaws_libp
pytest
python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```
 4. [Publish to gh-pages](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jaws-libp/actions/workflows/gh-pages-publish.yml) GitHub Action should run automatically.
